# Grid-Based Pathfinding Visualizer

This project is an interactive pathfinding simulation built with Pygame and Tkinter that allows users to visually explore grid-based pathfinding algorithms. The grid is divided into cells where users can set a starting point and a target point by clicking, while also adding obstacles by dragging the mouse to mark walls. Once the start and target points are established, the program employs a queue-based pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest path, visually marking the cells as they are visited, queued, or if they form part of the final path. If no solution is found, a message box alerts the user, making this project an educational tool for understanding pathfinding concepts in an engaging way.
